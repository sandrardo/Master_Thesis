# 🎓 Master Thesis Project — DSMarket

Welcome to the repository of **Lucía, Sandra, Samu, Jorge, and Cristian**! 😎

DSMarket is an end-to-end Machine Learning project built around a retail sales forecasting use case for a fictional supermarket chain operating in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.

## 📦 What's in this project

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** — sales trends, product popularity, price elasticity and variations across cities and stores
- **Clustering** — product segmentation (4 clusters via K-Means + ABC/XYZ classification) and store segmentation (3 clusters)
- **Sales Forecasting** — 28-day sales forecasting using XGBoost with skforecast, achieving a 54.7% WMAPE improvement over the baseline at chain level
- **BI Dashboard** — interactive Power BI report with 5 tabs for executive-level insights (sales overview, temporal analysis, store performance, product categories, and events impact)
- **Store Replenishment Use Case** —  proposal for an end-to-end MLOps solution including a REST API, CI/CD pipeline and MLflow model tracking, with a functional prototype of the web interface for stock replenishment recommendations
